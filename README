Kmc-Subset137 implements what described in the "ERTMS/ECTS; Online Key
Management FFFIS" SUBSET-137 v1.0.0 (17/12/2015)" Unisig document.
Additional information can be found at <http://www.kmc-subset137.eu/>.


README
------
This README is targeted for users of the library who build from
sources but do not necessarily develop.  If you are interested
in developing and contributing to the Kmc-Subset137 project, please
visit http://www.kmc-subset137.eu/Contributing.html.


COMPILATION
-----------
A typical command sequence for building the library is shown below.
    make

The commands above builds the following static archive
- libss137.a
- libtlswrapper.a (currently defaults to using GnuTLS)
and additional tesing binaries in kmc-core and emulators directories.

In you want to link to openssl library instead of default GnuTLS you
need to modify 'ss137/tls_wrapper/src/Makefile' accordingly.

The library depends on GnuTLS 
 * GnuTLS: TLSv1.2 implementation http://www.gnutls.org/
 ** version > v3.4.9 (needed to support mandatory
    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_254_GCM_SHA384 exchange)

The library has been tested on the following setup:
 * Fedora 23
 * Centos 7        (needs gnutls > v3.9.4 recompilation)
 * Ubuntu 14.04.04 (needs gnutls > v3.9.4 recompilation)


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
 * Missing KMC-PSK functionality
 

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
For documentation you need doxygen installed on your system
To build doxygen documentation use:
  make docs

Otherwise visit http://www.kmc-subset137.eu/Documentation.html

EXAMPLES
--------
The library can be tested via the executables contained in the directory
emulators.

PATCHES
-------
Patches are welcome and encouraged. Patches can be submitted through
the bug tracking system or the mailing list.  When submitting patches,
please be sure to use sources from the git repository, and preferrably
from the master branch. To create a patch for the project from a local
git repository, please use the following commands. 'kmc-subset137'
should be the local directory of a previous git clone.

    cd kmc-subset137
    git add the-file-you-modified.c another-file.c
    git commit the-file-you-modified.c another-file.c
    git format-patch
